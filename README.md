### Introduction

The purpose of this project is to add support for Semantic Augmentation of OpenAPI specification within **Swagger Editor** and **Swagger UI** tools. This enables us to  augment the existing Web API Specifications with Semantic support in order to derive both machine and human readable content in a better, more
comprehensive way.

The Web is becoming a large repository of open data, available for rich exploratory querying, machine processing such as generating visualizations, and for combining multiple data sources. The Semantic Web (Web 3.0) has been designed as a WWW extension that allows computing tools to search, combine and process content that is based on the meaning it has for us.
